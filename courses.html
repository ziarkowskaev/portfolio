									<p>Masterâ€™s programme in <b>Computer, Communication and Information Sciences</b><br />
										Major in <b>Software and Service Engineering</b><br />
										Minor in <b>Web Technologies, Application and Science</b></p>
								</header>
								<p>During my bachelor degree I took Computer Science as my minor, focusing on web development. After I graduated, I continued straight into my Master, majoring in Software and Service Engineering. In my studies, I focus on the human side of computer science. Apart from full-stack development, my main intrests are HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and RE (Requirements Engineering).</p>
